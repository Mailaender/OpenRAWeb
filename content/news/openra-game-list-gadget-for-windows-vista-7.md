Holloweye has spent the last while building a desktop gadget for Windows Vista and Windows 7, which puts the gamelist right on your desktop. [Download it](http://open-ra.org/openra-gadget-win.gadget), or check out the source at [GitHub](https://github.com/Holloweye/OpenRA-Gadget-for-Windows-7-Vista). Stay tuned for an engine update to allow launching directly into a lobby from an external gamelist like this, and also new versions of the Gadget code for Mac and Linux users.
